Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~
This cookbook enables instrument providers to create persistent identifiers (PID) for instruments using the ePIC infrastructure [1]_. ePIC is an international consortium that provides PID services for the worldwide research community, allowing them to allocate and resolve PIDs based on the handle system (TM, https://www.handle.net/). In 2019, ePIC published a metadata schema for citing instruments, as part of the recommendations resulting from the Research Data Alliance working group for the persistent identification of instruments (PIDINST) [2]_ referred to as the PIDINST metadata schema [3]_. This document provides technical guidance for publishing instrument PIDs through ePIC.
