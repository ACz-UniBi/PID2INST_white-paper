Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This cookbook enables instrument providers to create persistent
identifiers (PID) for instruments using the `ePIC infrastructure`_.
ePIC is an international consortium that provides PID services for the
worldwide research community, allowing them to allocate and resolve
PIDs based on the `handle system`_.  In 2019, ePIC published a
metadata schema for citing instruments, as part of the recommendations
resulting from the Research Data Alliance working group for the
persistent identification of instruments (`PIDINST`_) referred to as
the `PIDINST metadata schema`_.  This document provides technical
guidance for publishing instrument PIDs through ePIC.
