Persistent Identification of Instruments
========================================

The `Persistent Identification of Instruments WG (PIDINST)
<pidinst_>`_ seeks to explore a community-driven solution for globally
unique identification of measuring instruments operated in the
sciences.

Measuring instruments, such as sensors used in environmental science,
DNA sequencers used in life sciences or laboratory engines used for
medical domains, are widespread in most fields of applied sciences.
The ability to link an active instrument (instance) with an instrument
type and with the broader context in which the instrument operates,
including generated data, other instruments and platforms, people and
manufacturers, etc., is critical, especially for automated processing
of such contextual information and for the interpretation of generated
data.

PIDINST is a working group in the `Research Data Alliance (RDA)
<rda_>`_.  It aims to establish a cross-discipline, operational
solution for the unique and lasting identification of measuring
instruments actively operated in the sciences.

The group produced the following outputs:

* Stocker, M, Darroch, L, Krahl, R, Habermann, T, Devaraju, A,
  Schwardmann, U, D’Onofrio, C and Häggström, I.  2020.  Persistent
  Identification of Instruments.  Data Science Journal, 19: 18,
  pp. 1–12.  DOI: https://doi.org/10.5334/dsj-2020-018 :raw-html:`<br />`
  This paper provides an overview of the work of PIDINST.

* :ref:`white-paper` :raw-html:`<br />`
  This white paper provides recommendations for the use of instrument
  PIDs and gives technical details that go beyond the overview
  provided in the Data Science Journal paper.  It is expected to
  evolve with new user requirements and working group activities.

* :ref:`epic-cookbook` :raw-html:`<br />`
  Detailed instructions on how to create instrument PIDs using the
  ePIC infrastructure.
