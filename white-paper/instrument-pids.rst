Instrument PIDs
===============

The PIDINST PID is used to identify measuring instruments, defined by
the Joint Committee for Guides in Metrology (JCGM) as “device used for
making measurements, alone or in conjunction with one or more
supplementary devices” (VIM, 2012). It is used to identify the devices
themselves (instances), the real-world assets with instantaneous
capabilities and configurations, rather than the identification of
material instrument designs (models).
