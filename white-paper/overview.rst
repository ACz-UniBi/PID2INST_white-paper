Overview
========

This white paper provides recommendations for the use of instrument
Persistent Identifiers (PIDs) for institutional instrument providers,
such as bodies who fund, maintain or provide instruments, or are
responsible for maintaining information about or data from instruments.
Institutional instrument providers will be responsible for maintaining
and publishing instrument PIDs locally, potentially on behalf of other
institutional instrument providers. These recommendations are compiled
through the activities of the Research Data Alliance (RDA) Persistent
Identification of Instruments (PIDINST) Working
Group [1]_, [2]_. This document is expected to evolve with
new user requirements and working group activities.
