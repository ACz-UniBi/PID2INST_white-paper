Publishing new instrument PIDs
==============================

To create new PIDs and assign them to instruments, institutional
instrument providers will submit a metadata record following the PIDINST
metadata schema and a URL for the landing page of the instrument to a
PID provider that is compliant with RDA PIDINST recommendations. Thus,
it is necessary to become a member of the PID provider to publish PIDs
directly, or work with one of their current members or registration
repositories to publish PIDs on behalf of the institutional instrument
provider. Current PID providers known to be suitable with RDA PIDINST
are ePIC [3]_ and DataCite [4]_, but PIDINST is not limited to these
providers; others may implement the schema, too.
